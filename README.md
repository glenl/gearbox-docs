[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/gearbox-docs/badge/?version=latest)](https://gearbox-docs.readthedocs.io/?badge=latest)

Documentation for gearbox assets,
[deployed on readthedocs](https://gearbox-docs.readthedocs.io/),
a collection of gears and hardware
created with Blender.

## Changes for V1.3

 * Uses Blender 4.1 release candidate.

 * All gears are sized in meters instead of millimeters. This follows
   with the normal use of Blender and results in fewer problems when
   trying to merge vertices of very small components.

 * Added straight bevel gears.

 * Reduced vertex count on all pre-V1.3 gears.

 * Node group interface changes reflect new Blender features but no
   functionality was removed.

 * Pumped up documentation, added a working notes section.
