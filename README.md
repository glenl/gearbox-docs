# gearbox-docs

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/gearbox-docs/badge/?version=latest)](https://gearbox-docs.readthedocs.io/?badge=latest)

Documentation for gearbox assets,
[deployed on readthedocs](https://gearbox-docs.readthedocs.io/),
a collection of gears and hardware
created with Blender.

## Changes for V2

 * Uses Blender 4.3.2

 * All gears are sized in meters instead of millimeters. This follows
   with the normal use of Blender and results in fewer problems when
   trying to merge vertices of very small components.

 * Added straight bevel gears and a gear rack.

 * Reworked the cog mesh for better smoothing.

 * Pumped up documentation, added a working notes section.
