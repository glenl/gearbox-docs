Modeling Setup
==============

Gears are sized in millimeters. You can save yourself lots of sizing
pain by simply setting your scene properties to scale and use
millimeters as your are modeling. All the node images in this
reference document use these `Units` changes so the distances are
displayed in millimeters (`3mm` instead of `0.003`).
