 Installation
==============

This product is delivered as a
`Blender Asset Library <https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/files/asset_libraries/index.html>`_
and is designed to be used by the
`Blender Asset Browser <https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/asset_browser.html>`_ .
The first step is to move the asset file into the folder you have
designated as one of your asset file paths. In my setup I have a
folder named :file:`/home/glenl/modeling/assets`,

   A Blender asset preference dialog


Copy the downloaded :file:`.blend` file to that location and start
blender. The name on the left defaults to :file:`Assets` but you can
give it whatever name you want. There may be any number of asset files
in that folder. In blender, use the asset brower and navigate to that
asset library. If that is your only asset library you will see various
images of gears that you can select and drag into the geometry editor.

Modeling Setup
==============

Gears are sized in millimeters. You can save yourself lots of sizing
pain by simply setting your scene properties to scale and use
millimeters as your are modeling.
